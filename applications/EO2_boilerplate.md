## Project Overview

EO2's Mission is to contribute to a more inclusive, efficient, and reliable Carbon Market by providing all stakeholders with easier access to quality Carbon Credits. Our goal is achieved through the tokenization of regulated Carbon Credits and their (crypto-) representation into EO2 Digital Token, which reduces frictions and improves their usability and diffusion.
The core project function is represented in a smart contract that constitutes a two-way bridge between off-chain Carbon certificates and their in-chain Token representation. The smart contract is hosted on an EOSIO-based blockchain. To connect with the smart contract, users will interact with an app tailored according to the specific needs of each user class (Corporate or Individuals).
EOTWO has already developed an interface designed to facilitate the adoption from users with different level of experience with technology and digital assets. Developing an intuitive user interface that simplifies the customer journery (registration, wallet, etc.) and the product cycle (buy, sell, etc.) was a goal to attract users with different level of familiarity with technology and digital assets, and so promoting Carbon Markets inclusiveness.
For this grant proposal, EOTWO is looking for funds to improve the current web application by performir unit testing, an enhanced user interface in terms of design and the creation of video-manuals. In order to achieve this, we propose to share a version of our webapp with the EOS community, so designers, developers or enthusiast can plug and play their own EOSIO-Based token. 


The following video provides a simple overview of our EO2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yrKXtR34Do&t=3s 

### Overview

- **Name:** EO2 User Interface Boilerplate.
- **Brief Description:** User Interface ready to use and simple to setup for developers and other newcomers. 
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** EO2 offer a boilerplate so developers can plug and play their Token project with an User Interface that facilitate the use for non-crypto users.
- **Reason for Interest:** EO2 have been working for the past year in developing a solution for the carbon markets based on EOSIO-based blockchain. In order to keep funding our venture, we want to make available our code to help the EOS community to thrive. 

### Project Details

The project consists of a boilerplate of an UI that simplify the adoption of EOSIO-based blockchain technology as well as the adoption of non-crypto users considering in app payment system, multi - language characteristics and built-in connection with Anchor and Ledger as authorization providers.  
EOTWO will make open-source the following:
1.- Individual user Webapp: ReactJS 18 UI Boilerplate with JSS and material-UI for component designs. Account creation on EOSIO-based blockchain, Instruction to connect to the backend using AWS. Sidebar Menu with Dashboard, Assets, Support, and extra buttons for each project-specific development. The webapp will include the integration of external wallet such as ANCHOR and LEDGER.

EOTWO has already developed the main functions of the webapp and is looking for resources to complete it. In addition, we recently hire an UI designer that will enhance the look of the webapp.
The webapp is available in the following link to be analyzed by the committee: https://serene-biscotti-ca7162.netlify.app/
A preview of how the user inverface will looks like in the following link: https://xd.adobe.com/view/beb2bcc9-2e61-42a2-bc26-f28d8404792b-ebe1/
EO2 will provide a boilerplate with basic and adaptable capabilities of its User Interface and an Admin dashboard to evaluate the APP interaction. some sections in the menu will be available for the user to be modified for their project.
 What will not be shared with the community are the functionalities specific to the business logic behind EO2. 
EO2 can provide advice on using the boilerplate based on goodwill only. EO2 is not committed to providing support of any type in the development beyond the documentation of each component.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**

EOTWO will provie with a user interface to plug and play EOSIO-based token.

- **Who is your target audience (chain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?**

Apps developed by EOTWO that are ment to be open-source are aimed to Dapp/UI Developers.
We aim to provide developers with an easy to use user interface that will help the EOS community to attract a non-crypto user audience. 

- **What need(s) does your project meet?**

Since the raise of the crypto, more and more developers are turning into easy and scalable solutions to build their project over. Since 2021, EOTWO have been learning and developing a solution based on EOSIO, and we came across with multiple difficulties, lack of documentation, very few applications as example and not comprehensive tutorials. Thanks to the experience of our programmers and the help of the EOS community we manage to overcome those difficulties. Now, EOTWO wants to make this transition smoother by providing, during this first stage, an easy to setup boilerplate.

- **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the EOSIO ecosystem? If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?**

There are some user interface boilerplates, and some templates available to be bought, but we know by experience that those are complicated and not as easy to use as EOTWOâ€™s

## Development Status

**IT Development Status:**

We have already developed a MVP having the basic business fuction for our project. 

The web application is hosted on AWS. Additionally, we have a NodeJS service running to get requests from the web application. That requests are made by API calls using REST protocols. 
All our source code is hosted on Github in a private account connected with AWS to do the deploys on the server machine.
We use git-flow architecture to work on our repositories.
